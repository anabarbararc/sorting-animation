# Sorting Animation

## Description

Fun coding exercise. 

Simple Python script comparing three famous sorting algorithms.

By using the Matplotlib's Animation class, the output shows the algorithms in action.
The input for the histograms is a shuffled array with 20 elements ranging from 1 to 20.

Each sorting algorithm returns two objects: 
1) an array of arrays; each array represents the intermediate state after each iteration in the sorting process
2) an integer representing the number of swaps

The animation is saved in a gif file.
